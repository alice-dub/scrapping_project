# scrapping_project

This script scraps the wikipedia page https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_de_morts_insolites 
and extract the list of insolit dead people and their death dates. 

It's a small project to learn how to parse html and how to use regex. 

To run it you will need Python 3 and Beautiful Soup library.
